HiTMAn - High Throughput Microbial Analysis

Hitman is a pipeline for analysing 16S rRNA amplicon datasets. Tree steps are
necessary:

1/ hitman_hire: Collect sequences to analyze from SFF files.
2/ hitman_deploy: Quality-filter and trim the sequences.
3/ hitman_execute: Produce a rarefied OTU table with taxonomic assignments.

Run these scripts with the --man flag to learn more about what they do.
