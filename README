HiTMAn - High Throughput Microbial Analysis

Hitman is a pipeline for analysing 16S rRNA amplicon datasets. The defaults
values make it suitable for bacterial and archaeal profiling in 454 and Illumina
datasets.

Three types of input files are necessary:
1/ SFF (or FASTQ) files containing regular or paired-end amplicon reads (can be
   gziped)
2/ FASTA file containing the primers used. The primer from which sequencing
   proceeded must be first in the file.
3/ If the sequencing run was multiplexed, a 2-column tabular mapping files
   indicating the multiplex identifiers (MIDs)
   used for each sample.

The pipeline itself comprises three steps:
1/ hitman_hire: Collect amplicon reads to analyze from SFF/FASTQ files.
2/ hitman_deploy: Quality-filter and trim the sequences.
3/ hitman_execute: Produce a rarefied OTU table with taxonomic assignments.

Run these scripts with the --man flag to learn more about what they do.
